# Advent of Code 2024

This project contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/), implemented in both Python and/or Java. (depends on the mood honestly)

## TODO List

### General
- [ ] Create a project description in the README.
- [ ] Set up a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files like `target/` or IDE-specific folders (`.idea/`).
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are documented for both Java and Python.
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing (e.g., GitHub Actions).

### Java
- [ ] Implement solutions for missing days in Java.
- [ ] Add Java unit tests for existing solutions.
- [ ] Document how to compile and run Java solutions.

### Python
- [ ] Separate Python unit tests to a Test module for the existing solutions.
- [ ] Set up a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for dependencies.
- [ ] Document how to run Python scripts for each day.

### Project Enhancements
- [ ] Create shared utility functions for repetitive tasks (e.g., file input parsing).

### Documentation
- [ ] Add detailed instructions for setting up the project locally.
- [ ] Create a folder for additional documentation (`docs/`) with:
  - [ ] Input for each day.
